<H3> Parser Description </H3>

<H4>Overview</H4>
The SCIRun parser is designed to give the user the ability to evaluate almost
any expression at the elements of a matrix or field. The underlying engine of 
the parser assumes that every field or matrix can be represented by an array of
scalars, vectors, or tensors. For example a field can be represented by an array
of scalars for the field data and an array of vectors for the locations of the
nodes. In order to maintain a reasonable performance while interpreting a user
defined function, the engine will apply each mathematical operations to the full 
array at same time. The logic of the parser will allow the user to write several
expression at the same time, which will optimized to remove any duplicate
function calls and the operations will be untangled in a series of elementary
operations that have to be executed.


<H4>Using the parser</H4>
<p>Each parser has a couple of preloaded variables available to the user. These
preloaded varaibles in SCIRun are always denoted with an upper case variable
name. For example for the CalculateFieldData has the following variables 
available:</p>

<p>DATA, X,Y,Z, POS</p>

<p>The variables can be used in the user to construct a new variable. For
example, one can write the following equation:</p>

<p>MYDATA = sin(X)+cos(Y);</p>

<p>This will assign the value of sin(X)+cos(Y) to MYDATA, where X and Y are the arrays 
containing the X and Y positions of the nodes. Note that to generate a new 
variable, no new variable type needs to be declared. The parser will automatically
derive the type of the output variable. For example the following case will
generate vector data:</p>

<p>MYDATA = vector(Y,X,2*Z);</p>

<p>As the output of the expression is a vector MYDATA will now be an array of 
vectors instead of an array of scalars as in the previous example.</p>

<p>To assign any data to the output of a module, certain variables need to be
assigned. For example in case of the CalculateFieldData, the output variable is
called RESULT and hence a second expression can be added to assign the newly
created vector to the output: </p>

<p>MYDATA = vector(Y,X,2*Z); RESULT = MYDATA;</p>

<p>Now this expression could have been simplified to one expression, which would
result in the same operation:</p>

<p>RESULT = vector(Y,X,2*Z);</p>

<p> From a performance perspective both would be evaluated equally fast as, 
copying operations are generally removed by the internal optimizer. However to
increase user readability one can split an expression in as many pieces as one
wants. For example, the following expression is perfectlt valid expression:

<p>DX = X-3; DY = Y-4; DZ = Z - 2; RESULT = norm(vector(DX,DY,DZ));</p>

<p>Hence the general grammar of the expression is: </p>

<p> VAR1 = function(...); VAR2 = function(...); VAR3 = function(...); ... etc</p>

<p> The array parser generally allows two types of input, an array with one 
element, or an array with many elements. When combining multiple fields or 
matrices, the arrays with many elements are required to have the same number of
elements and the math operations are done by taking correspondeing elements from
each array. However an array with one element is treated special, and its value
is used for every element for the arrays that have many arrays. For example, 
assume matrix A = [1], and B = [1,2,3,4]. We can now evaluate the following
expression:</p>

<p> RESULT = A+B;</p>

<p>In this case RESULT will be [1+1,2+1,3+1,4+1] and hence allows for scalar
parameters to be added into the expressions.</p>


<H4>Available functions</H4>
<p>The following basic operators have been implemented for Scalars, Vectors, and
Tensors:</p>

<p> +, -, *, /, ==, !=, !, &&, || </p>

<p>In addition to these operators the following functions are available:</p>

<p> add(),sub(),mult(),div(), exp(), log(), ln(), log2(), log10(), sin(), cos(),
tan(), asin(), acos(), atan(), sinh(), cosh(), asinh(), acosh(), pow(), ceil(),
floor(), round(), boolean(), norm(), isnan(), isfinite(), isinfinite(), select(),
sign(), sqrt(), not(), inv(), abs(), and(), or(), eq(), neq() </p>

<p>For vectors the following functions are available:</p>

<p>To construct a vector use the following function:</p>
<p> MYVECTOR = vector(X,Y,Z); </p>

<p> To access the components of a vector use the following functions: </p>
<p> X = x(MYVECTOR); Y = y(MYVECTOR); Z = z(MYVECTOR) </p>

<p>The following vector specific functions are available:</p>
<p>dot(), cross(), normalize(), find_normal1(), find_normal2()</p>

<p>For tensors the following functions are available:</p>

<p>To construct a tensor use the following functions:</p>
<p> MYTENSOR = tensor(XX,XY,XZ,YY,YZ,ZZ); </p>
<p> MYTENSOR = tensor(SCALAR); </p>
<p> MYTENSOR = tensor(EIGVEC1,EIGVEC2,EIGVAl1,EIGVAL2,EIGVAL3); </p>

<p> To access the components of a tensor use the following functions: </p>
<p> XX = xx(MYTENSOR); XY = xy(MYTENSOR); XZ = xz(MYTENSOR) </p>
<p> YY = yy(MYTENSOR); YZ = yz(MYTENSOR); ZZ = zz(MYTENSOR) </p>
<p> EIGVEC1 = eigvec1(MYTENSOR); EIGVEC2 = eigvec2(MYTENSOR); EIGVEC3 = eigvec3(MYTENSOR) </p>
<p> EIGVAL1 = eigval1(MYTENSOR); EIGVAL2 = eigval2(MYTENSOR); EIGVAL3 = eigval3(MYTENSOR) </p>

<p>The following tensor specific functions are available:</p>
<p>quality(), trace, det(), frobenius(), frobenius2(), fracanisotropy()</p>

<p>For converting any Scalar, Vector or Tensor in to a boolean, e.g. whether all
components are equal to zero or not, the function boolean() provided: </p>

<p>RESULT = boolean(vector(X,0,Z)); </p> 
<p>RESULT = boolean(vector(X,0,Z)) || boolean(tensor(4)*0); </p> 

<p>The select() function works like the C/C++ ternary ?: operator: </p>

<p>RESULT = select(X>2,1,0); </p>

<p>To insert a random number two functions are provided, rand() and randv().
Neither of them take any input. The first one just render a single random number
and the second renders an array of the same size as the other arrays. For example
to render uniform distributed noise between 0 and 2 for a field, use the
following expression: </p>

<p>RESULT = 2*randv();</p>

<p> If on the other hand all the values need to be the same, but one random value,
use :</p>

<p>RESULT = rand();</p>

<p>Finally, we have an object called element, which refers to the element of a mesh.
The latter only exists as an input object, but allows the user to query, properties
like element quality metrics and sizes. Currently the following functions are implemented:</p>

<p>center(),volume(),size(),length(),area(),dimension()</p>
